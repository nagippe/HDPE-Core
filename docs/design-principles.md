# HDPE Design Principles

1. All operations must have legitimate functional reasons.
2. No fake checks, dummy data, or misleading behavior.
3. Compatibility is evaluated continuously, not once.
4. Failure at any stage results in immediate termination.
5. Temporary memory must be wiped after use regardless of success or failure.
6. Offline environments are not supported by design.
